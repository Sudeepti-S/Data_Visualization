This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
install.packages("tidytext")
library(tidytext)
install.packages("textdata")
```




Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
```{r}


install.packages("textdata")
install.packages("syuzhet")
library(syuzhet)
my_example_text <- 

  "I begin this story with a neutral statement.  
  Basically this is a very silly test.  
  You are testing the Syuzhet package using short, inane sentences.  
  I am actually very happy today. 
  I have finally finished writing this package.  
  Tomorrow I will be very sad. 
  I won't have anything left to do. 
  I might get angry and decide to do something horrible.  
  I might destroy the entire package and start from scratch.  
  Then again, I might find it satisfying to have completed my first R package. 
  Honestly this use of the Fourier transformation is really quite elegant.  
  You might even say it's beautiful!"



s_v <- get_sentences(my_example_text)

class(s_v)

str(s_v)

head(s_v)

```

```{r}
nrc_data <- get_nrc_sentiment(s_v)

angry_items <- which(nrc_data$anger > 0)
s_v[angry_items]

joy_items <- which(nrc_data$joy > 0)
s_v[joy_items]



install.packages("pander")
library(pander)

pander::pandoc.table(nrc_data[, 1:8], split.table = Inf)
```

```{r}
s_v[joy_items]
```

```{r}
barplot(
  sort(colSums(prop.table(nrc_data[, 1:8]))), 
  horiz = TRUE, 
  cex.names = 0.7, 
  las = 1, 
  main = "Emotional Analysis of Tweets", xlab="Percentage"
  )
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
